<h2 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>About Me</h2>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">
  I am currently looking for a full-time software engineering position starting June of 2021. 
  I graduated Loyola Marymount University with a degree in computer science and would like to pursue a job opportunity that would allow and encourage me to put my skills to use in a challenging and collaborative environment. 
  My studies at Loyola Marymount University has provided me the opportunity to work on many projects that use React, Java, Python, C++, C, Go, and many more languages. 
  Along with my studies at LMU, I spend much of my free time working on Raspberry Pi projects.
  I work well in both group collaborative and independent settings. 
  In small groups, I excel at contributing technical solutions and effectively communicate with my team to overcome technical challenges. 
  I am a confident public speaker and I have the ability to communicate my ideas both verbally and in writing. When given a problem to solve, I look for creative solutions and work diligently until the problem is resolved.
